# caesar-cypher-cracker
An &lt;overcomplicated> project to efficiently break caesar cyphers written in rust!

Usage:\n
- caesar_cracker&lt;.exe> "some caesar cypher"
- caesar_cracker&lt;.exe> "some filepath" --load_file
Flags:\n
- --animate -> Outputs each possibility as it is considered, adds short delay so you can see each print.
- --load_file -> Rather than specifying the cypher inline, load it from a file.
